Refactor code to avoid duplication and improve performance.

## General changes:
- Creates a main `tsconfig` file to be extended by packages;
- Configures `ssx-core`as a new package on the monorepo;
- Removes duplicate `@changesets/cli` dependency.

## @spruceid/ssx-core creation: 
- This package was created to held the types definitions and utils functions to all packages. This reduces the amount of duplicated code, prevent circular dependencies, reduces package sizes (tree-shaking during transpilation), and ensures that changes to the API will need a bump to this new package.
- To unify the packages some interfaces/types names were updated:
  - `@spruceid/ssx-sdk`: `SSXConfig` -> `SSXClientConfig`;
  - `@spruceid/ssx-sdk`: `SSXProviders` -> `SSXClientProviders`;
  - `@spruceid/ssx-sdk`: `SSXSession` -> `SSXClientSession`;
  - `@spruceid/ssx-server`: `SSXConfig` -> `SSXServerConfig`;
  - `@spruceid/ssx-server`: `SSXProviders` -> `SSXServerProviders`;

## @spruceid/ssx changes: 
- Adds `@spruceid/ssx-core` as a dependency;
- Removes all types and interfaces declarations. They were moved to `ssx-core`;
- Exports `SSXConfig` (deprecated) and `SSXClientConfig`;
- Exports `SSXProviders` (deprecated) and `SSXClientProviders`;
- Exports `SSXSession` (deprecated) and `SSXClientSession`;
- Removes all utils functions. They were moved to `ssx-core`;
- Optimizes `try/catch` blocks;
- Updates `examples/ssx-test-dapp` to support ENS resolution from `examples/ssx-test-serverless-dynamodb-api`.

## @spruceid/ssx-react changes:
- Updates `ssxConfig?: SSXConfig;` on `SSXProviderProps` to `ssxConfig?: SSXClientConfig;` (non breaking change). 

## @spruceid/ssx-gnosis-extension changes:
