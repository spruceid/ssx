# SSX NextAuth with Email Example

This is an example dapp for ssx-react. It's a Next.js app that uses the ssx-react library to implement a simple login flow. It was generated from create from [RainbowKit's Create Dapp template](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) and then modified to use ssx-react for signing in.

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
