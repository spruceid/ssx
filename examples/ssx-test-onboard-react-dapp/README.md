# SSX Test Onboard React Dapp

This is a simple React Dapp that demonstrates how to use ssx-react with Blocknative's `web3-onboard` web3 provider.

# Getting Started
There are a few steps to get started with this example:
1. Build the dependencies in the root monorepo (`yarn install` in root)
2. In this project copy `env.example` to `env.local`
3. Build the project locally with `yarn`
4. Run the development server with `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
