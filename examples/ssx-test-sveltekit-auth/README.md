# ssx-test-sveltekit-auth

This example is forked from the official SvelteKit Auth example by [Auth.js](https://sveltekit.authjs.dev). It is a simple login flow to view a protected page using SSX as an Auth.js provider.

## Getting started

create a .env file by running `cp .env.example .env` in this directory and filling in the values.
You can run the app with the following commands:
`yarn && yarn dev`
