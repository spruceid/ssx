# SSX Next 13 with App Folder

This is an example dapp for ssx using NextJS 13 with App folder. It's a Next.js app that uses the ssx library to implement a simple login flow. It was generated from  [Create Next Dapp template](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) and then modified to use ssx-react for signing in.

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
